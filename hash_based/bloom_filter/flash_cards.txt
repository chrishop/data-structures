What are Bloom Fillters?;Bloom filters are space-efficient probabilistic data structures.
What can a Bloom Filter say about a given element; either probably in the set, or definitely not
What operations can be performed on a Bloom Filter, complexities?;add element O(n), query element O(n), notice you can't remove an element
What is the drawback of a Bloom Filter;The more items added the larger the chance of a false negative
When is a good situation to use a Bloom Filter?;Bloom filters are good to use if the source data is impractically large
What is a good example use case of a Bloom Filter?;A good example of a use case for a bloom filter may be a spell checker
What advantages to Bloom filters have over other Data Structures?;Bloom filters have huge space advantages over other set datastructures
Equation to measure false positives of bloom filters;e = (1-(1-(1/m))^kn)^k
Equation for optimal number of hash functions, bloom filter; k = (m/n) * ln(2)
Equation for false positive rate of bloom filters; m = (nln(e))/((ln2)^2)
Equation for approximation of elements in a bloom filter; n = - m/k * ln(1 - X/m) (X is number of bits set to 1)
What properties are desirable in a bloom filter hash function; to be fast, for the output to be uniform
